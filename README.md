# BOSCH KCT Translator Windows Application

This repository contains a collaborative project between KCT Coimbatore students and Bosch Global Software Technologies to develop a translation service app for automotive aftermath manuals.

## Application functionality
The Windows application, built using WinUI3, allows users to upload a text file, Word document, Excel file, or submit a raw text string. Using Microsoft Azure Translate, the entered text is transposed into the desired language, providing a seamless and efficient translation process.

## Database compatibility
To increase efficiency, the application integrates with a MySQL database that stores previous translations. This feature not only enhances translation speed by minimizing redundant translation processes but also serves as a valuable repository for automotive aftermath manual translations.

## Potential expansion
Currently in its prototype phase, the vision for this project extends beyond its current form. Future developments include transitioning to a web-based application hosted on Microsoft Azure and an expanded database system to store an increasing volume of translations. This systematic expansion aims to cover all automotive aftermath manuals, providing an extensive repository of automotive technical translations.
