# KCT-BSGW Translation Utility built with .NET and AzureSQL

This project is a collaboration between a myself, a student of Kumaraguru Collage of Technology and Bosch Global Software Technologies. The aim is to create a Windows application using WinUI3 that can accept a text file, word file, excel file, or raw text string from the user and translate it using Microsoft Azure Translate. The translated file is then generated by the application. 

A Microsoft SQL database is connected to the application to increase the efficiency of translation by storing previous translations. The ultimate goal is to create a database that covers translations for most Automotive Aftermath Manuals. This prototype will eventually be implemented in the industry by creating a web application and hosting it on Microsoft Azure, along with the database for storing translations.

Okay, I can help you make your content more concise and specific. Here is a revised version of your features heading in markdown:

## Features of KCT-BSGW Translation Utility

- **Modern and intuitive user interface** The application uses WinUI 3, the latest Windows UI library, to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Powerful and accurate text and document translation** The application leverages Microsoft Azure Translate, a cloud-based AI service, to enable translation across more than 100 languages. The application also allows customization of translations to reflect domain-specific terminology and style.
- **Efficient and scalable data management** The application uses Azure SQL Database, a fully managed relational database-as-a-service, to store and access translation data with ease, security, and performance. The application also benefits from Azure SQL Database's intelligent features, such as automatic tuning, cost optimization, and data residency.
- **Innovative and industry-oriented solution** The application creates a database that covers translations for most Automotive Aftermath Manuals and implements it in the industry as a web application hosted on Microsoft Azure. This enables faster and easier access to multilingual information for automotive professionals and customers.
- **Versatile and adaptable project** The application can be repurposed to use in many other use cases that require text and document translation, such as education, tourism, media, and entertainment. For example, the application can be used to translate course materials, travel guides, news articles, and subtitles.

### Prerequisites
- [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?cid=learn-onpage-download-cta) (recommended) or Visual Studio 2019.
- [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16)
- Tools for the Windows App SDK. Install using the following command:
```
winget install "Visual Studio Community 2022"  --override "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop Microsoft.VisualStudio.ComponentGroup.WindowsAppSDK.Cs" -s msstore
```

## Try it Out ( placeholder api key - translation won't work )


## Build from Source
1. Clone the repository using
```
git clone https://github.com/KarthiDreamr/MultiFile_AzureTranslate_WindowsApp.git
```
2. The `App.xaml` file and code-behind file(s) define an `Application`-derived class that represents your running app. The `MainWindow.xaml` file and code-behind file(s) define a `MainWindow` class that represents the main window displayed by your app. These classes derive from types in the `Microsoft.UI.Xaml` namespace provided by WinUI 3.
3. Replace the placeholder key in the MainWindow.xaml.cs with your Azure Translate instance key.
4. Press the run button after selecting debugging or release build as you needed.
